# Member Updates
Nick - Reviewed ECE GitHub meeting minutes and began reviewing CSC GitHub.
Gerardo - Got access to ME Teams documentation.



# Old Business:
- Determine existence of other teams on project (ME, CS)
	- CS Capstone group will not begin their project until Fall 2026 semester.
	- Gerardo, Nick, and Daniel met with Dr. Pardue Tuesday (02/03/2026) to discuss the possibility of an ME leg of the Capstone project.  Discussion boils down to Dr. Pardue will put the project out to the students and see what he gets in terms of interest.  Ideally, two robots will be used in the project timeline: 1 built by ME team and 1 as a test bed for the EE/CS team(s).  
- Brainstorm supervisor
	- Dr. Van Neste (Power)
		- Yet to be contacted.
	- Dr. Canfield (Mechatronics)
		- Contacted 02/04/2026 - Willing to help however he is very busy and may not always be available.
	- Dr. Alouani (Controls, Mechatronics)
		- Contacted 02/03/2026 - Agreed to be available but does not want to be on paper for any recognition.  
	- Dr. Austen (ECE)
	- Vandergriff (CS)
		- Contacted 02/03/2026
		- Recommended ARC's (Autonomous Robotics Club) Coby Smith, Joseph Dye as points of contact.
		- Also recommended Ben Burchfield.
	- Owen O'Connor (Embedded)
		- Yet to be contacted.
- Determine DEVCOM schedule
	- As of 02/03/2026, the funding bill intended to restart the government has passed the House and will go to the White House for signature.  
	- DEVCOM contact is imminent. 

# New Business
- Team contract revision
	- Dr. Storm has left the following comments for revisions:
	![[Pasted image 20260203155752.png]]
	- Define "excused" vs "unexcused" absences and consequences for repeat offenses.
	- Consequences for missed deadlines/incomplete deliverables
	- Operating procedures for voting (Quorum)
- New potential supervisor: Dr. Rizvi (Controls, Autonomous Vehicles/Systems)
	- Appointment with Dr. Rizvi at 2:30 PM on Tuesday to discuss Dr. Rizvi's potential involvement in the project.
- Spring 2025 CS Capstone GitHub Repo (Link: https://github.com/ttu-bburchfield/CirceSoft)
	- Team gained access to the GitHub Repo.
- Spring 2025 ME Documentation
	- Gerardo got access to the ME Teams documentation and will send documentation to the teams.  
	- Overall, previous team's documentation is difficult to traverse and piece together useful information.  Documentation stopped in May 2025.  
- Reviewing ECE Capstone Meeting Minutes
	- Nick
	- Brady (Reviewed Conceptual design)
		- CirceBot: ME/EE
		- CirceSoft: CSC team
		- Hardline communication: EE
		- EE team builds the robot to build the robot to receive information from CirceSoft
		- DEVCOM supposedly has their own Circesoft. Contradiction on who provides Circesoft (CSC team or DEVCOM)?
		- CD discusses battery usage between LiPo and LiFePO4
			- Either battery may be contradicting with battery in the robot
		- Navigation is via waypoint
		- Team followed TIA cable standard ANSI/TIA-568.2-d for maximum cable of 103 yards before signal degradation/packet loss.
		- Cable spool must be removable/installed within 2 minutes without external tools.  
		- Circe Bot must stop when final waypoint is reached.  
		- Conceptual design is unclear about Circe Bot performance once it reaches its final waypoint.
			- Does the robot need to unload itself and begin returning the C2 within 2 minutes?
			- Does the robot need to wait until someone comes up to the robot to manually unload the ethernet within 2 minutes?
	- Gerardo
		- Meeting minutes from ME team
			- Operate for 20 minutes
			- Last team held biweekly meetings with DEVCOM on Mondays
			- Discussed roles.
			- Team discussed tracks vs. wheels
			- Discussed powering spooling mechanism
			- Talked to Tristan Hill about robot
			- Worried about the autonomous section
			- ISO safety requirements
			- Wanted to make a working drive train for ECE team by end of Capstone 1
# Do Outs:
- Clean work table in Capstone room
- Confirm schedule of CS capstone (When would CS capstone work begin?)
- Add revised Team Contract to GitHub pull request.
- DEVCOM meeting topics:
	- Ask for clarification of robot's necessary capabilities.  Should we expect a human at the final waypoint to unload the spool?
- Review Robot Fusion 360 models to determine robot internals.
- Meet with Ben Burchfield on Monday 10AM - 11AM
